# Machine Learning
This repository documents my independent journey learning machine learning outside of my formal university education. I've developed my own learning approach driven by my passion for data analysis and artificial intelligence.

Here, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my progress and understanding - from simple models like regression-based prediction systems to more advanced implementations including deep learning architectures.

Each project folder contains detailed documentation, code implementations, and insights gained through the process. I believe in learning by doing, and these projects represent my hands-on approach to mastering machine learning concepts.

## Coming Soon
- Regression Models for Prediction
- Classification Techniques
- Deep Learning Applications

I'm continuously adding new projects as I progress in my learning journey. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or reach out if you'd like to collaborate!

Let's learn together! ðŸš€ðŸ“Š
